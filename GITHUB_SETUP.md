# How to Push Your Project to GitHub

Follow these steps to upload your project to GitHub and submit it.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Complete the registration

## Step 2: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `taskflow-assignment` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: "Full-stack task management app with authentication - Frontend Developer Assignment"
   - **Visibility**: âœ… Public (so recruiters can see it)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

### Option A: If you see the setup page

Copy the repository URL (should look like):
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow-assignment.git
```

### Option B: Run these commands in your terminal

Open terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow-assignment.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. Check that README.md displays properly

## Step 5: Get Your Repository Link

Your repository URL will be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow-assignment
```

Copy this link - you'll need it for submission!

## Step 6: Prepare Email Submission
